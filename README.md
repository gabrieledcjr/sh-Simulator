sh-Simulator
============

Implemented a Unix sh simulator based on a lab assignment in CptS 360 (Systems Programming). The objective is to understand how the Unix sh works by using fork/wait/exec. It also requires a good knowledge of string operations. I have implemented the bonus part of the assignment which allows multiple pipes.
